Algorithms & Data Structures
============================

A list of various data types, algorithms, and data structures which can be implemented in any programming language.

============================

Details:

* I will be implementing most of the programs in Java.
* For practice: I may include C++, Python, or Ruby versions as well.

============================

## Connected Components

The **union-find** data type models the *partitioning* of a set of elements, in order to keep track of *connected components* in an *undirected graph*.

The algorithms will perform two main operations:

  * **Find** - check if two elements are in the same subset. (Are they connected?)
  * **Union** - merge two subsets into one.

### Implementations:

  * Java
   * [Quick-Find](https://github.com/robertcorreiro/Algorithms-and-DataStructures/blob/master/src/union_find/QuickFindUF.java)
   * Quick-Union
   * Weighted Quick-Union
   * Weighted Quick-Union with Path Compression
